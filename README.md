# MusicTourist
An Android app that enables the player to play custom music in Mario Kart Tour. 

## Currently in alpha
This app currently functions, but it is not well-tested. Bugs will occasionally occur,
and features are incomplete. \
The apk will be released once it is considered stable enough.

For people who wish to try out the app now, please clone this repo into Android Studio, and build the app.

## How to use
### Add a song
1. Press the "+" button in the main screen to choose the music file you want to replace with.
2. Enter the corresponding information in the dialog.
- Start time and loop time means the range that the music will loops in.
This is useful for music like Coconut Mall, where the intro will not play on loop.
- Alternatively, you can extend the music with audio editing software such as Audacity. This ensures the music loops in your favour.
3. Once every information is entered, press "OK".
### Enable custom music in Mario Kart Tour
1. Press the "Start" button.
2. Android will then ask if you wish your screen content to be captured by the app. 
Press "Start now" to confirm.
- If the dialog is cancelled, the enabling process will end, and custom music will not play.
3. Once you have confirmed the dialog, Mario Kart Tour will automatically be launched. /
Custom music will now be played for the corresponding course.
- Turn off in-game Music (via in-game option menu) to make music not overlap with each other.
4. Once you exit the game (or wanted to disable cistom music), press the notification to disable custom music.
